# Raytracing
This is a path tracer based on; [Raytracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), [Raytracing the next week](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html), and [Raytracing the rest of your life](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html). There are some features from [Physically Based Rendering](https://www.pbrt.org/) and a number I came up with (although I am likely not the first to come up with them).

This project was also implemented on the GPU using CUDA, see [Raytracing_GPU](https://github.com/daRoyalCacti/Raytracing_GPU).

All images created are available in [/images](https://github.com/daRoyalCacti/Raytracing_GPU/tree/master/images). Some noteworthy images are seen below.
